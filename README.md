## 🖥 Live Demo 🚫

Since the data that was used in this application cannot be shared publicly, it has been removed from the public repository, so having a working application was not possible.

[Care to translate](https://caretotranslate.com/) was developing Ux for a new app, and they wanted to do under the working name “Care to Translate - Educate,” which will serve as a tool for healthcare professionals who want to learn medical terms in other languages.
They wanted to create the first version of the app (written in React-Native with Typescript).
